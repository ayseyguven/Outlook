# Outlook

Build on Xcode - 8.3.3

I am Abhishek Dutt, graduate of IIT Roorkee , batch 2016. 
I have been working in iOS for last one year in Quikr . Have been using both Objective-c and Swift. I also have previous working background in Php and Java and related backend tech stack.

I have tried completing the IOS task for building Calendar as in Outlook mocks as mentioned in the ReadMe here in the given schedule.
All the updated code is in the master branch.

Will be adding the introduction, description, thought process in the ReadMe file , and how further I would have refactored by today Evening. 
Have also tried adding simple weather info in events from Forecast.io .
Will be finishing and refactoring the code a little bit by evening and will update the master.
